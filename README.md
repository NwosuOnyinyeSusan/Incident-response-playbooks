# TechCrush Project 1: Incident Response Playbooks

This repository contains structured Incident Response Playbooks I developed as part of my cybersecurity training projects.

Included Playbooks:

   - Identification and verification steps  
   - Containment, eradication, and recovery procedures  
   - Lessons learned and reporting

2. Ransomware Attack Incident Response Playbook  
   - Immediate detection and isolation guidelines  
   - Removal and recovery strategies  
   - Post-incident review and improvement steps

3. DDoS Attack Incident Response Playbook  
   - Detection indicators and impact assessment  
   - Mitigation, service restoration, and prevention measures  
   - Documentation and future readiness recommendations


About This Project

Each playbook is structured to:

- Provide clear, actionable steps for responding to specific security incidents  
- Enhance organisational readiness and reduce response time  
- Align with standard incident response frameworks such as NIST and references to MITRE ATT&CK where applicable


Purpose

These playbooks were created to strengthen my understanding of:

- The incident response life cycle  
- Practical defensive operations in a SOC environment  
- Documentation and communication in cybersecurity defence strategies
