   - Documentation and future readiness recommendations


About This Project

Each playbook is structured to:

- Provide clear, actionable steps for responding to specific security incidents  
- Enhance organisational readiness and reduce response time  
- Align with standard incident response frameworks such as NIST and references to MITRE ATT&CK where applicable


Purpose

These playbooks were created to strengthen my understanding of:

- The incident response life cycle  
- Practical defensive operations in a SOC environment  
- Documentation and communication in cybersecurity defence strategies
